                    I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A in Cognitive Science.
                I'm currently working as a private tutor for Tutor Corps teaching math, 
                psychology, and biology. I have taken some computer science classes at
            Berkeley, I'm familiar with Python, Java, R, SQL, and Matlab. I want to learn more
            about full stack development and hopefully get a job as a full stack developer soon.</p>
